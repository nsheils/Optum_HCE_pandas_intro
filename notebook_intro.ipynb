    "\n",
    "Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of the **NumPy** package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in **SciPy**, plotting functions from **Matplotlib**, and machine learning algorithms in **Scikit-learn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in text editors just as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations. Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandas’ DataFrames and plots. "
